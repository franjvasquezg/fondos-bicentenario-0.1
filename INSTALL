The simplest way to compile this package is:

  To create a deb file using the program debuild:

1.   if you dont have debuild installed, type "sudo apt-get install devscripts".

2.  "cd" to the directory containing the package's source code and type "debuild".

3.   Then type "cd .." and install the created deb file with "sudo dpkg -i cortina*.deb"




Build and install without packaging it:


1. To create the Makefile, type "qmake".

2. After that it can be build: "make".

3. Then type "make install" with root rights.
